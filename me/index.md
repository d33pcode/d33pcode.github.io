I am d33pcode, a coder obsessed with privacy and PCs,
Co-Founder of MMB Team and HiddenHost.

My mission is to understand computers enough to make them do exactly what i want,
and not the opposite.

The only reason I made this site is to have a place where to write random stuff
about coding, tech and other things i want to share or just need to keep,
if this bores you, feel free to leave; otherwise, you are welcome here.

If you need to contact me, you can write to my
[mail address](mailto:mpanunzio@hiddenhost.org).
You can also follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/d33pcode)
or take a look at my [Github](https://github.com/d33pcode) profile.
